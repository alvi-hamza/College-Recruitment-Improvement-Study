#  College Recruitment Improvement Study
 The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals from the under-represented groups in its computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). You have been tasked to perform exploratory data analysis on the survey dataset that is provided. Your analysis will inform the department about which/when/where/why students are taking their classes (as indicated in the survey dataset), so that they can focus their recruiting efforts in those areas that are successful, particularly for the under-represented groups.
